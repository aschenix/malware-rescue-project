DISCLAIMER:
I, Eric Nielsen, am in no way shape or form responsible for any damage caused by the use of this program (removal.bat) or any of the programs included in this toolkit.

You, yourself (herein being called the 'end user') assume ALL responsibility and are unable to hold the creator of this program nor the creators of it's supporting applications responsible in ANY manner whether it be financial, technical or legal.

This is a STOP-GAP MEASURE, and NOT a full time anti-virus! This is for heavily infected machines and in NO WAY is to be used as a full time antivirus, antimalware, anti-ransomeware, anti-etc type of security program.  It is at it's heart, basically a huge toolkit I have utilized over the years that I thought might be of some use to the common user before they go and call for outside help.  Outside help which is extremely expensive!

=======================================================================================

This tool runs in any Windows mode and can even in many circumstances retrieve encrypted data from the much dreaded "ransomware."

Double click on removal.bat and it will prompt you for Administrator rights.
Press Yes or it WILL NOT WORK!  :D

Each program will run.  If something asks you to update it- go ahead and do it.

***************************************

IMPORTANT:
Should you be infected with RANSOMWARE and it does NOT automatically decrypt it for you, AFTER every other scan is done, take one of the still ENCRYPTED files and drag and drop it over the decryption programs located in the folder called 'Ransomware-Decrypters.'

PLEASE - VERY IMPORTANT - WRITE DOWN ON PAPER THE NAME OF THE STRAIN OF WHAT IT IS INFECTED WITH!

***************************************

FOR THOSE WHO ARE LOCKED OUT OF WINDOWS TOTALLY:
- Use a non-infected machine and download this ZIP file in it's entirety
- Unzip the file and look for the folder called 'Rescue'
- You will need a USB thumb drive (any size will do, but at least 500MB or 1GB
- Insert thumb drive via USB port
- Run the supplied program 'rufus' in that folder
- Make sure the thumb drive you want to use is the selected device
- Make sure everything is clicked EXCEPT for "Check device for bad blocks"
- Click on the drop down next to "Create a bootable disk using" and select kav_rescue_10.iso and make sure FreeDOS is selected.  It may ask to download something- press YES!
- Click on the CD rom icon next to it and press START when it says READY
- When it finishes, restart the PC
- Depending upon your computer, you are looking for the Boot Menu or Device Order
- This button can be:  Delete or F2. The keys F1, F9, F10, F11, F12 may also be the right one

***************************************

- There are 33 different applications here to scan for a plethora of types of infections
- There are 61 different variations of randsomware encrypted decryptors
- These 61 decryptors work in a manner much like dragging and dropping.
- If you do in fact have an anti-virus that has (at this point) apparently let you down, disable it for the time being as it will interfere with the scan's speed and capability!
